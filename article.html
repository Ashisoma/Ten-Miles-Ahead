                    Going out and doing something new is the undertaking of a long journey that few care to make the first stride. The leap contradict the beliefs that either genetically programmed into us growing up or we took up for the keep safe. Through out history man started out as a beast with the notion “to survive”.  However, the moment he went out of his cave he had more than just to survive. Man had to strive for more tomorrow than yesterday on today. 
Just think about it, man then invented fire made tools, migrated, boats, sedentary living and latterly more and more to make like better. Someone got tired going to sleep early to make the light bulb, it took a lot of time to reach out to someone for urgent communication and telephone lines were laid out. Achieving feats to become better and understand our complexity and limits has led human being in achieving bigger feats.
It all started with a thought. What if I stated sleeping less and work on myself. What if I put those countless hours on TV Instagram, twitter or whatever it is I take my time in. if I shut up in in a room with a pen and paper to write down my thought and ideas. Choose to go and learn something new something that will make my life better
